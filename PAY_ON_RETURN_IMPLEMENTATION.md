# Pay on Return Email Implementation

## Overview
Implemented "Pay on Return" functionality that sends a detailed booking confirmation email to customers when they choose to pay at the outlet upon returning the outfit.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Frontend (MyBookings.jsx)
- Added two payment buttons: **"Pay Now"** and **"Pay on Return"**
- Buttons only appear when booking status is **'confirmed'**
- Buttons are positioned side-by-side above the Remove button
- Black background styling with hover effects
- "Pay on Return" button triggers email sending functionality

### 2. Backend API

#### New Route
- **POST** `/api/booking/send-pay-on-return-email`
- Protected route (requires authentication)
- Validates booking ownership and confirmed status

#### Controller Function
- `sendPayOnReturnConfirmation` in `bookingController.js`
- Validates booking exists and belongs to the user
- Ensures only confirmed bookings can use this feature
- Calls email service to send confirmation

### 3. Email Service

#### New Function: `sendPayOnReturnEmail`
Located in: `backend/services/emailService.js`

**Email Content Includes:**
- Booking ID
- Outfit image (if available)
- Outfit details (brand, model, category, location)
- Rental period (reservation and return dates)
- Customer information (name, email, phone)
- Total amount to pay on return

**Email Styling:**

- Easy to read for outlet staff
